## ROS message types

### Channels

An array of radio control pulse-width modulation (PWM) values in units of microseconds.

Typically analog radio control pulses are published at 50Hz and each pulse lasts
between 1000 and 2000 Âµs.

The channel PWM values may also be obtained by decoding a radio control serial
signal such as SUMD which operates at a higher frequency (100 Hz).
